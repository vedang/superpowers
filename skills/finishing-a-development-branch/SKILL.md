# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Run project's test suite
make test
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Present Options

Present exactly these 4 options:

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Rebase back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.

### Step 3: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Rebase Locally

```bash
# Pull latest
jj git fetch

# Rebase feature branch
jj rebase -d main -s <feature-branch>

# Verify tests on merged result
make test
```

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push branch
jj git push -c @-

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullets of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification steps>
EOF
)"
```

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>."

#### Option 4: Discard

Inform the human that they should discard and cleanup the commits

## Quick Reference

| Option           | Merge | Push |
|------------------|-------|------|
| 1. Merge locally | ✓    | -    |
| 2. Create PR     | -     | ✓   |
| 3. Keep as-is    | -     | -    |
| 4. Discard       | -     | -    |

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping test verification**
- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR
- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options

**Open-ended questions**
- **Problem:** "What should I do next?" → ambiguous
- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options

**Automatic worktree cleanup**
- **Problem:** Remove worktree when might need it (Option 2, 3)
- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4

**No confirmation for discard**
- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work
- **Fix:** Require typed "discard" confirmation

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Present exactly 4 options
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only

- **executing-plans** (Step 5) - After all batches complete
