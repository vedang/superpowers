# Superpowers Release Notes

## v3.2.0 (2025-10-18)

### New Features

**Design documentation in brainstorming workflow**
- Added Phase 4: Design Documentation to brainstorming skill
- Design documents now written to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` before implementation
- Restores functionality from original brainstorming command that was lost during skill conversion
- Documents written before worktree setup and implementation planning
- Tested with subagent to verify compliance under time pressure

### Breaking Changes

**Skill reference namespace standardization**
- All internal skill references now use `superpowers:` namespace prefix
- Updated format: `superpowers:test-driven-development` (previously just `test-driven-development`)
- Affects all REQUIRED SUB-SKILL, RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL, and REQUIRED BACKGROUND references
- Aligns with how skills are invoked using the Skill tool
- Files updated: brainstorming, executing-plans, subagent-driven-development, systematic-debugging, testing-skills-with-subagents, writing-plans, writing-skills

### Improvements

**Design vs implementation plan naming**
- Design documents use `-design.md` suffix to prevent filename collisions
- Implementation plans continue using existing `YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md` format
- Both stored in `docs/plans/` directory with clear naming distinction

## v3.1.1 (2025-10-17)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed command syntax in README** (#44) - Updated all command references to use correct namespaced syntax (`/superpowers:brainstorm` instead of `/brainstorm`). Plugin-provided commands are automatically namespaced by Claude Code to avoid conflicts between plugins.

## v3.1.0 (2025-10-17)

### Breaking Changes

**Skill names standardized to lowercase**
- All skill frontmatter `name:` fields now use lowercase kebab-case matching directory names
- Examples: `brainstorming`, `test-driven-development`, `using-git-worktrees`
- All skill announcements and cross-references updated to lowercase format
- This ensures consistent naming across directory names, frontmatter, and documentation

### New Features

**Enhanced brainstorming skill**
- Added Quick Reference table showing phases, activities, and tool usage
- Added copyable workflow checklist for tracking progress
- Added decision flowchart for when to revisit earlier phases
- Added comprehensive AskUserQuestion tool guidance with concrete examples
- Added "Question Patterns" section explaining when to use structured vs open-ended questions
- Restructured Key Principles as scannable table

**Anthropic best practices integration**
- Added `skills/writing-skills/anthropic-best-practices.md` - Official Anthropic skill authoring guide
- Referenced in writing-skills SKILL.md for comprehensive guidance
- Provides patterns for progressive disclosure, workflows, and evaluation

### Improvements

**Skill cross-reference clarity**
- All skill references now use explicit requirement markers:
  - `**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:**` - Prerequisites you must understand
  - `**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:**` - Skills that must be used in workflow
  - `**Complementary skills:**` - Optional but helpful related skills
- Removed old path format (`skills/collaboration/X` → just `X`)
- Updated Integration sections with categorized relationships (Required vs Complementary)
- Updated cross-reference documentation with best practices

**Alignment with Anthropic best practices**
- Fixed description grammar and voice (fully third-person)
- Added Quick Reference tables for scanning
- Added workflow checklists Claude can copy and track
- Appropriate use of flowcharts for non-obvious decision points
- Improved scannable table formats
- All skills well under 500-line recommendation

### Bug Fixes

- **Re-added missing command redirects** - Restored `commands/brainstorm.md` and `commands/write-plan.md` that were accidentally removed in v3.0 migration
- Fixed `defense-in-depth` name mismatch (was `Defense-in-Depth-Validation`)
- Fixed `receiving-code-review` name mismatch (was `Code-Review-Reception`)
- Fixed `commands/brainstorm.md` reference to correct skill name
- Removed references to non-existent related skills

### Documentation

**writing-skills improvements**
- Updated cross-referencing guidance with explicit requirement markers
- Added reference to Anthropic's official best practices
- Improved examples showing proper skill reference format

## v3.0.1 (2025-10-16)

### Changes

We now use Anthropic's first-party skills system!

## v2.0.2 (2025-10-12)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed false warning when local skills repo is ahead of upstream** - The initialization script was incorrectly warning "New skills available from upstream" when the local repository had commits ahead of upstream. The logic now correctly distinguishes between three git states: local behind (should update), local ahead (no warning), and diverged (should warn).

## v2.0.1 (2025-10-12)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed session-start hook execution in plugin context** (#8, PR #9) - The hook was failing silently with "Plugin hook error" preventing skills context from loading. Fixed by:
  - Using `${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}` fallback when BASH_SOURCE is unbound in Claude Code's execution context
  - Adding `|| true` to handle empty grep results gracefully when filtering status flags

# Superpowers v2.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview

Superpowers v2.0 makes skills more accessible, maintainable, and community-driven through a major architectural shift.

The headline change is **skills repository separation**: all skills, scripts, and documentation have moved from the plugin into a dedicated repository ([obra/superpowers-skills](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-skills)). This transforms superpowers from a monolithic plugin into a lightweight shim that manages a local clone of the skills repository. Skills auto-update on session start. Users fork and contribute improvements via standard git workflows. The skills library versions independently from the plugin.

Beyond infrastructure, this release adds nine new skills focused on problem-solving, research, and architecture. We rewrote the core **using-skills** documentation with imperative tone and clearer structure, making it easier for Claude to understand when and how to use skills. **find-skills** now outputs paths you can paste directly into the Read tool, eliminating friction in the skills discovery workflow.

Users experience seamless operation: the plugin handles cloning, forking, and updating automatically. Contributors find the new architecture makes improving and sharing skills trivial. This release lays the foundation for skills to evolve rapidly as a community resource.

## Breaking Changes

### Skills Repository Separation

**The biggest change:** Skills no longer live in the plugin. They've been moved to a separate repository at [obra/superpowers-skills](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-skills).

**What this means for you:**

- **First install:** Plugin automatically clones skills to `~/.config/superpowers/skills/`
- **Forking:** During setup, you'll be offered the option to fork the skills repo (if `gh` is installed)
- **Updates:** Skills auto-update on session start (fast-forward when possible)
- **Contributing:** Work on branches, commit locally, submit PRs to upstream
- **No more shadowing:** Old two-tier system (personal/core) replaced with single-repo branch workflow

**Migration:**

If you have an existing installation:
1. Your old `~/.config/superpowers/.git` will be backed up to `~/.config/superpowers/.git.bak`
2. Old skills will be backed up to `~/.config/superpowers/skills.bak`
3. Fresh clone of obra/superpowers-skills will be created at `~/.config/superpowers/skills/`

### Removed Features

- **Personal superpowers overlay system** - Replaced with git branch workflow
